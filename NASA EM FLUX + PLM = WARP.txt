In response to NASA's development of an EM impulse drive:

Quoted from my Post on my page in FB:

EM Flux works , and the warp coil will come ... 
think an evolved LHC .... 
add to it a way to channel and tune the particle field it emits as a quantum stream... 
soon enough .. I'd say give it another 50 years... it's really just this simple
.... think of space as multi dimensional matter 
so the easiest way to calculate it's volume would be to apply :
(0/1 =X) * ( PI) * (-X) * Lambda over MU * (Y = -x to the power pi by negative x * Mu over Lambda) = Z . So Z divided by E will give you then the variance needed to create a sustainable quantum field (Q) ...
so at which point you can utilize (Pi / E * Q) - ( Pi * Lambda / MU )to generate a propulsion field
