# PLM Algebraic Proofs

Theorem 1 (Factorization):
    S = ((π·Y)(λ·X))/(μ·C) = (π·λ/μ)·(X·Y/C)

Proof:
    By associativity and commutativity of multiplication.
    QED.

Theorem 2 (Bilinearity):
    Scaling X or Y scales S linearly.

Theorem 3 (Ratio Invariance):
    Scaling X and C by the same factor leaves S unchanged.

Theorem 4 (Monotonicity):
    For positive parameters, S increases strictly with X.

Theorem 5 (Sign Determination):
    sign(S) = sign(π·λ·X·Y / μ)

These results establish algebraic stability but make no claims regarding cryptographic security.
