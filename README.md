PLM

Algorithms based via pi lambda mu calculation


The Base Algorithm for all of these projects is: PI Multiplied by, LAMBDA -- 
over MU 
Hence the name PLM

Mathmatically if: Pi(P) , Lambda(L), and Mu(M)

Your baseline to solve NP hard would look simmilar to this if Applied to an SSH/SSL scenario.

   {(P) by Y } by {(L) by X } over {(M) by C } = S

In this case Y is the hexidecimal value for the Public key hash as a child of Chain of Authoriy hash, C is the crypted data's  block size + the file crc hash sting value in decimal (a sha1 or md5 hash converted to a decimal exponential will do as well), and S is the Secret/Private Key
