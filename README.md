Algorithms based via pi lambda mu calculation


The Base Algorithm for all of these projects is PI*LAMBDA/MU

The initial release will be a refactored  set of block encryption cyphers loosley based on KHAZAD and Anubis
Further implimentations will include products of the initial work into Mahout.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anubis_(cipher) for details on Anubis and further links to KHAZAD

Meaning this solves ... x for y every time .. prove it wrong ... i'm trying... serriously... please add all validations or attempts to disprove this solve NP hard and other things... 
\or show it can't  ... I'll gladly debug  all examples... and contrary Proofs

I invite the world to please prove this wrong... 
because I cannot! 


Applying this in various  languages  will come later .... 

all current  internal existing source code has  currently held for that reason... 
..
